                                <h2>Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982</h2>
                                <h3>By Cho Nam-Joo</h3>
                            </hgroup>
                            <main>
                                <p>Content warning: alcoholism, depression, pregnancy & childbirth, miscarriage, abortion, bullying.</p>
                                <p>Reading Cho Nam-Joo's "Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982" sparked a level of reflection that I did not expect when initially picking up such a short novel. This tiny book consumed me, leaving me unable to put it down. It tells the story of Kim Jiyoung, a Korean woman grappling the myriad ways in which misogyny is embedded within society, while exploring the realities of the lives of countless women whose only purpose seems to be marriage and motherhood. We follow Jiyoung's journey throughout childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, and marriage, written in a highly captivating and enthralling way that hooked me from the first sentence until the last. I particularly enjoyed the extensive character development witnessed throughout this novel, not only on Jiyoung's part - her mother and sister really stood out to me as well-rounded, dimensional characters who felt incredibly raw, vulnerable, and real. By pushing every boundary and challenging every limit, I would recommend this novel to anyone who is able to get their hands on it. This was an obvious five-star read that I have not been able to stop thinking about ever since I finished it. A true literary work of art that made me excited to read whatever Cho Nam-Joo publishes in the future.</p>
                                <blockquote>"Jiyoung became different people from time to time. Some of them were living, others were dead, all of them women she knew. No matter how you looked at it, it wasn't a joke or a prank. Truly, flawlessly, completely, she became that person." - <cite>Cho Nam-Joo</cite></blockquote>

                                <h2>Yellowface</h2>
                                <h3>By Rebecca F. Kuang</h3>
                            </hgroup>
                            <main>
                                <p>Content warning: racism, bullying, cyberharassment, sexual assault, emotional abuse, suicidal ideation, alcohol consumption, emesis, grief, death.</p>
                                <p>R. F. Kuang's Yellowface was an interesting exploration of race, class, and cultural appropriation to say the least. Highly satirical and bustling with social commentary, this novel follows struggling author June Hayward as she claims her dead friend's manuscript about Chinese labourers during World War I as her own and completely transforms herself to reflect a Chinese identity that did not belong to her. However, alongside the accolades and June's newfound success came a devastating wave of criticism that threatens her career.</p>
                                <p>This novel was a brilliant case study of the publishing industry, particularly in terms of the roles of minority authors, oftentimes pigeonholed into writing solely about their identity and the trauma experienced by their community. The unreliable narrator, the deliberately unlikeable characters, and the sheer discomfort that bled through each page made me think about the extent to which the publishing industry truly aims to give them a voice rather than use them as "token diversity characters" in the name of false inclusivity solely for marketing purposes. Is this truly beneficial or does this only further oppress them? Overall, this novel sparked very necessary conversations about cultural appropriation and erasure, the perpetuation of harmful narratives, privilege, representation, accountability, and authenticity. Most of the criticism towards this novel proves its exact point - I think R. F. Kuang did a fantastic job of painting a caricature of the publishing industry while addressing the complexity of race and culture and, above all, the integrity of one's identity.</p>

                                <p>A messy, fun, charming inside look into the mind of a young woman in Ireland, filled to the brim with chaos and laughs while discussing the complexity of class, sexuality, relationships, and forming one's identity. This book follows Rachel Murray and her nearly sibling-like friendship with her coworker turned flatmate James Devlin as they progress through their twenties. From complicated relationships with boyfriends and university professors to being young and poor in a tanking economy, this novel radiates authenticity and growth. I grew attached to the characters, whose bad decisions and naivete I related to. Their character development was astonishing - O'Donoghue did an admirable job portraying their growth and maturity throughout the novel. The Rachel Incident is easily one of the best coming-of-age novels I've read thus far - a true masterpiece.</p>
                                <blockquote>"When something good happens to you at that age, you can't settle with the notion that it's a one-off. You want it to be the beginning of a tradition. That's how I felt about that night: I wanted it already to be a memory, a foundational one, a first evening of many similar evenings. I wanted future nostalgia, a rear-view, years-old fondness for something that had literally just happened." - <cite>Caroline O'Donoghue</cite></blockquote>

                                <h3>By Coco Mellors</h3>

                                <p>Content warning: addiction, alcoholism, drug abuse, death, infidelity, rape, emesis, mental illness, sexual content, abuse.</p>
                                <p>Blue Sisters broke my heart and healed me all at once. As Avery, Bonnie, and Lucky navigate the loss of their beloved sister Nicky, this novel addressed grief, family, addiction, mental health, sexuality, and a range of other intricate, complex facets of the human experience. Full of emotion, Blue Sisters is an exploration of the intricate dynamics of a dysfunctional family, the pain of loss, and the path towards healing as three estranged sisters who could not appear more different from each other reunite following the one-year anniversary of their sister's death. Mellors masterfully weaves a narrative that is both deeply personal and universally relatable. The characters are richly developed, each with their own unique struggles and growth throughout the story - as different as they are, they all share an impulsive character and a reliance on addictive, self-destructive behaviours as a coping mechanism for a lifetime of grief and trauma. The interplay between the sisters is authentic and poignant, capturing the essence of sibling relationships—the love, the rivalry, and the unspoken bonds that tie them together.</p>
                                <p>The novel's exploration of grief is particularly powerful. Mellors does not shy away from the raw and often messy emotions that accompany loss, making the reader feel deeply connected to the characters' journeys. The sisters' individual paths to healing are portrayed with sensitivity and depth, highlighting the resilience of the human spirit and the enduring power of family.</p> 
                                <p>"Blue Sisters" is a triumph, a novel that manages to be both heart-wrenching and hopeful. It is a testament to the strength of familial bonds and the importance of finding one's place in the world. This is a book that will stay with you long after you've turned the last page, making you reflect on your own relationships and the ways in which we all seek to find connection and meaning in our lives.</p>
                                <blockquote>"A sister is not a friend. Who can explain the urge to take a relationship as primal and complex as a sibling and reduce it to something as replaceable, as banal as a friend? Yet this status is used again and again to connote the highest intimacy. True sisterhood is not the same as friendship. You don't choose each other and there is no furtive period of getting to know each other. You are a part of each other, right from the start. Look at an umbilical cord—tough, sinuous, unlovely, yet essential—and compare it to a friendship bracelet of brightly woven thread. That is the difference between a sister and a friend." - <cite>Coco Mellors</cite></blockquote>
